    <h3>My Journey</h3>
    <p>I am a first year student in <strong>USICT</strong> in IT branch. I was born in <em>Sri Ganganagar, Rajasthan</em> lived there for 17 years.
        Then I went to <em>Gurgaon</em>to prepare for my JEE exam, stayed there for 2 years but I was not able to qualify my JEE advanced examination.
        It was disheartning for me, but I never gave up hopes and by the grace of God, due to my JEE Main's result I was given a seat in <em>IP University</em>
